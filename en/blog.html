            <p class="text">
              &emsp; On August 8th and 9th, we had the pleasure of taking part in the SparkHope Robotics Cup, an offseason 
              competition-type charity event organized by the Eastern Foxes team (RO_191/19098). The event took place in Ploiești,
              at the University of Oil and Gas, where the team has its hub, and the purpose of the event was to raise funds 
              for the <b>#SpitalePubliceDinBaniPrivați</b> campaign.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;With a lot of excitement and positivity, our team left for Ploiești, where the first day was 
                dedicated to setting up the stands, along with surprises received from the organizers that consisted of a detailed escape room and fascinating 
                conferences with speakers in the field, from whom we learned a lot of interesting information. The second day, however, brought the heavy curtain 
                of the long-awaited competition, and with our arrival inside the University, you could feel an atmosphere that was about to erupt with 
                the passing of time.
                <br />&emsp;The competition itself was sprinkled with very good moments, but also with a few key situations, 
                from which we had only to learn for the future. But overall, this brought us confidence before the new 
                season in our strengths, but it was also an important moment for our new members, 
                who had their first experience at such an event.
                <br><br>&emsp;We would like to express our gratitude to the organizers, <b>Eastern Foxes</b>, for their involvement, 
                seriousness, and passion for always pushing the boundaries of this wonderful field towards progress.

              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;This was an opportunity to rebuild our competition robot from scratch,

                <br />&emsp;At the same time, participating in this edition of STC gave us the chance to test our skills and 
                the new robot, to enjoy the spirit of competition during the off-season alongside

              &emsp;Between June 23<sup>rd</sup> and July 4<sup>th</sup>, the bootcamp was organized for the <b>Programming</b> and <b>Mechanics</b> departments, 
              and between July 16 and 18, the bootcamp was organized for the non-technical department, for <b>PR</b> and <b>Graphics</b>.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;Recruitment took place in 3 stages: the <b>form</b>, the <b>interviews</b> and the <b>bootcamp</b>. The interviews were 
                organized by the ZENITH team, and the questions were asked by members of the specific department to which the candidates 
                were applying.
                <br />&emsp;During this period, we monitored the creativity and involvement of each candidate in order to best choose the new members 
                of the ZENITH team who represent us and to give each participant the chance to be part of the team.
                <br />&emsp;The <b>bootcamp period</b> is the part where newcomers communicate with members who already have experience 
                and who have been in the club for a long time, thus managing to combine enthusiasm with patience and learning.
                <br />&emsp;Each activity was designed to test the participants' skills and way of thinking, 
                thus managing to give us a picture of each of them. The exercises were diverse depending on each department,
                such as: persuasive monologue at <b>PR & Marketing</b>, logo redesign at Graphics, building a brand new robot at <b>Mechanics</b> 
                and developing its code at <b>Programming</b>.
                <br><br>&emsp;The <b>Bootcamp</b> was not only a period of selecting new members, but also a period in which <b>competitiveness</b> and <b>team spirit</b> 
                merged to create a united team that can overcome any challenge.

              the magic of nature combined with the spectacle that man can create in communion with it.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;With this thought in mind, our team prepared thoroughly to offer visitors an unforgettable experience in the vast field of 
                robotics and STEM sciences, while keeping alive the care for nature and the environment. During this event, we chose to organize 
                ourselves in the form of a stand, where we would exhibit the most important elements of our club, both from the technical side: the FTC Robot, 
                fables; and from the non-technical side: magnets, key chains, stickers.
                <br />&emsp;In addition to the major interest shown for the Competition Robot, to which our team responded 
                with great patience and skill, we made available to our guests the club's 3D Printer, with which we offered 
                new perspectives in the production of promotional materials and more, and the visitors, visibly interested, 
                had numerous provocative questions, to which we answered with confidence, passion, and great attention to detail.
                <br />&emsp;With the help of superlative working conditions provided by the organizers, 
                our club not only managed to offer an interesting experience to the over 1000 visitors 
                and fascinating new perspectives in the field of robotics, but also managed to carry forward the tradition and 
                values of this important event, always dedicated to the delicate connection of man with the nature that surrounds him.
                <br/><br/>&emsp;We would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity 
                and we will participate in as many such urban and interesting events as possible in the future.

                <br />&emsp;The presented projects were structured around two
                main themes: "Smart City" and "Colonizing the Planet Mars". In

                college into a representation of the planet Mars, while the
                physics laboratory was set up to represent planet Earth. On
                "planet Mars" we presented the FTC robot and Fable-type robots,
                which demonstrate our skills in robotics and advanced
                engineering. These projects highlighted the technological
                potential necessary for the exploration and colonization of
                other planets. On "planet Earth" we showcased a wide range of
                smart solutions for the urban environment. Among our projects
                were a smart house, a functional elevator with sensors, and
                mini Lego car-robots with automatic traffic lights.
                <br /><br />&emsp;In addition, we simulated advanced research

                <br />&emsp;The first week of the bootcamp took place
                in-person, in the SmartLab of the "Grigore Moisil" National
                College. It started with an introduction to the FIRST Tech
                Challenge, and after a lot of theoretical information about
                robotics, the mechanics department had to build a robot
                inspired by the PowerPlay season. CAD courses were also held,
                where students learned to design various parts in Fusion 360,
                as well as to print them using 3D printers. In addition, the
                programming department presented several applications created
                with the help of Arduino boards, while the graphics and PR
                departments held workshops on social media posts, poster design
                and contacting sponsors.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The second week of the bootcamp was held
                online, and students enjoyed several programming, graphics, and
                PR sessions, accompanied by discussions based on the GM0
                robotics manual.
                <br /><br />&emsp;They were two wonderful weeks in which, in
                addition to the technical knowledge gained, the new members had
                the chance to meet other people who share the same passion as
                them—robotics.

            <p class="text">
              &emsp;The EggDrop Challenge is a competition organized by the
              Zenith Robotics Club at the "Grigore Moisil" National College. It
              involves creating a device designed to protect an egg, dropped
              freely from a certain height (the first or second floor).
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;In 2023, the second edition of this competition
                took place, where the creativity and enthusiasm of our
                colleagues exceeded our expectations. During the event, each
                team had the opportunity to test their device up to two times,
                with the best result being taken into account. Thus, the prizes
                were awarded based on the performance of the devices, the
                technical notebook (which contained information about the
                project’s construction process), and the jury’s vote.
                <br /><br />&emsp;We are happy to promote the applicability of
                physics and to closely observe the talent and ingenuity of our
                school’s students.

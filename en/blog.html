            <p class="text">
              &emsp;With Christmas approaching, on December 18, 2024, we decided to
              surprise the kindergarten students of the “Saint Andrew” Day Center in
              Drumul Taberei with a robot presentation and a few surprises.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;During the activity, we briefly introduced the 30
                children to what the FTC competition is about and showed them how
                Fable robots and a robot built in collaboration with NextLab work,
                sparking the magic of robotics. After the presentation, we handed
                out ornaments made with 3D printers, Christmas-themed stickers with
                our team’s mascot, and the children were fascinated by all the
                things technology can create. Thus, we had the chance to bring joy
                to the kids before the winter holidays and to showcase the beauty of
                robotics even to the youngest generation, using the Christmas
                spirit.

              unique opportunity to share our team’s vision and achievements
              in highly relevant and important fields.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;The presented projects were structured around two
                main themes: "Smart City" and "Colonizing the Planet Mars". In
                this context, we transformed the SMART laboratory of the
                college into a representation of the planet Mars, while the
                physics laboratory was set up to represent planet Earth. On
                "planet Mars" we presented the FTC robot and Fable-type robots,
                which demonstrate our skills in robotics and advanced
                engineering. These projects highlighted the technological
                potential necessary for the exploration and colonization of
                other planets. On "planet Earth" we showcased a wide range of
                smart solutions for the urban environment. Among our projects
                were a smart house, a functional elevator with sensors, and
                mini Lego car-robots with automatic traffic lights.
                <br /><br />&emsp;In addition, we simulated advanced research
                centers in fields such as optics, nuclear energy, and medicine,
                using specific equipment and images. These centers were
                designed to illustrate the complexity and diversity of
                scientific research that can contribute to the technological
                and scientific development of society.
                <br /><br />&emsp;We are glad we had the opportunity to present
                our projects in front of such a prestigious audience and that
                we contributed to promoting the STEM field!

                build a functional robot in 48 hours, using only the parts we
                brought with us from Bucharest. In addition to gaining
                knowledge about mechanics and programming, we met many robotics
                teams from all over the country, forming friendships with young
                people passionate about the same fields as us.
                <br /><br />&emsp;In the competition finals, we were chosen in
                an alliance by the Modus Vivendi team, alongside whom we won

              &emsp;In the summer of 2023, the "Zenith" robotics club organized
              a bootcamp for new members. This training period consisted of two
              weeks during which students learned basic notions of robotics
              from mentors or senior members.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;The first week of the bootcamp took place
                in-person, in the SmartLab of the "Grigore Moisil" National
                College. It started with an introduction to the FIRST Tech
                Challenge, and after a lot of theoretical information about
                robotics, the mechanics department had to build a robot
                inspired by the PowerPlay season. CAD courses were also held,
                where students learned to design various parts in Fusion 360,
                as well as to print them using 3D printers. In addition, the
                programming department presented several applications created
                with the help of Arduino boards, while the graphics and PR
                departments held workshops on social media posts, poster design
                and contacting sponsors.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The second week of the bootcamp was held
                online, and students enjoyed several programming, graphics, and
                PR sessions, accompanied by discussions based on the GM0
                robotics manual.
                <br /><br />&emsp;They were two wonderful weeks in which, in
                addition to the technical knowledge gained, the new members had
                the chance to meet other people who share the same passion as
                them—robotics.

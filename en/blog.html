              &emsp;During the weekend of August 16-17, Mega Mall Bucharest became a place of innovation and technology,
              hosting the "Robotics for All - MEGA Edition" event organized by the <b>Boogeybots #19061</b> team.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;During the two exciting days, enthusiasts of all ages had the opportunity to discover the

                atmosphere, taking part in watching demonstration matches that aroused the excitement of the audience. 
                It was also here that new friendships were formed, amid a shared passion for the STEM field.
                <br><br>&emsp;We thank the organizers for the invitation and for the involvement granted in making 
                a memorable event.

            <p class="text">
              &emsp; On August 8th and 9th, we had the pleasure of taking part in the SparkHope Robotics Cup, an offseason 
              competition-type charity event organized by the Eastern Foxes team (RO_191/19098). The event took place in Ploiești,
              at the University of Oil and Gas, where the team has its hub, and the purpose of the event was to raise funds 
              for the <b>#SpitalePubliceDinBaniPrivați</b> campaign.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;With a lot of excitement and positivity, our team left for Ploiești, where the first day was 
                dedicated to setting up the stands, along with surprises received from the organizers that consisted of a detailed escape room and fascinating 
                conferences with speakers in the field, from whom we learned a lot of interesting information. The second day, however, brought the heavy curtain 
                of the long-awaited competition, and with our arrival inside the University, you could feel an atmosphere that was about to erupt with 
                the passing of time.
                <br />&emsp;The competition itself was sprinkled with very good moments, but also with a few key situations, 
                from which we had only to learn for the future. But overall, this brought us confidence before the new 
                season in our strengths, but it was also an important moment for our new members, 
                who had their first experience at such an event.
                <br><br>&emsp;We would like to express our gratitude to the organizers, <b>Eastern Foxes</b>, for their involvement, 
                seriousness, and passion for always pushing the boundaries of this wonderful field towards progress.

              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;Recruitment took place in 3 stages: the <b>form</b>, the <b>interviews</b> and the <b>bootcamp</b>. The interviews were 
                organized by the ZENITH team, and the questions were asked by members of the specific department to which the candidates 
                were applying.
                <br />&emsp;During this period, we monitored the creativity and involvement of each candidate in order to best choose the new members 
                of the ZENITH team who represent us and to give each participant the chance to be part of the team.
                <br />&emsp;The <b>bootcamp period</b> is the part where newcomers communicate with members who already have experience 
                and who have been in the club for a long time, thus managing to combine enthusiasm with patience and learning.
                <br />&emsp;Each activity was designed to test the participants' skills and way of thinking, 
                thus managing to give us a picture of each of them. The exercises were diverse depending on each department,
                such as: persuasive monologue at <b>PR & Marketing</b>, logo redesign at Graphics, building a brand new robot at <b>Mechanics</b> 
                and developing its code at <b>Programming</b>.
                <br><br>&emsp;The <b>Bootcamp</b> was not only a period of selecting new members, but also a period in which <b>competitiveness</b> and <b>team spirit</b> 
                merged to create a united team that can overcome any challenge.

                Many visitors were impressed by how our work combines creativity with technology, and their curious 
                questions showed us that the interest in robotics is constantly growing.
                <br><br>&emsp; We thank everyone who joined us for this event and hope that the experience they have had will 
                inspire them to join us in the future, making "Grigore Moisil" a place where the passion for robotics comes to life.

                robotics and STEM sciences, while keeping alive the care for nature and the environment. During this event, we chose to organize 
                ourselves in the form of a stand, where we would exhibit the most important elements of our club, both from the technical side: the FTC Robot, 
                fables; and from the non-technical side: magnets, key chains, stickers.
                <br />&emsp;In addition to the major interest shown for the Competition Robot, to which our team responded 
                with great patience and skill, we made available to our guests the club's 3D Printer, with which we offered 
                new perspectives in the production of promotional materials and more, and the visitors, visibly interested, 
                had numerous provocative questions, to which we answered with confidence, passion, and great attention to detail.
                <br />&emsp;With the help of superlative working conditions provided by the organizers, 
                our club not only managed to offer an interesting experience to the over 1000 visitors 
                and fascinating new perspectives in the field of robotics, but also managed to carry forward the tradition and 
                values of this important event, always dedicated to the delicate connection of man with the nature that surrounds him.
                <br/><br/>&emsp;We would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity 
                and we will participate in as many such urban and interesting events as possible in the future.

                <br />&emsp;During the practical sessions, we worked in teams
                to implement what we had learned, which allowed us
                to improve our collaboration and coordination within the group. Another
                memorable aspect of the event was the organization of small
                competitions by the NextLab team, which brought added
                enthusiasm and motivation. These competitions put our
                logical thinking, reaction speed and innovative spirit to the test,
                transforming learning into a pleasant and dynamic experience.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The event organized by NextLab was
                more than a simple demonstration - it was a source of
                inspiration and an experience that enriched both our knowledge and
                passion for technology.

            <p class="text">
              &emsp;On November 7, 2024, we organized a robotics workshop for middle school 
              students, as part of the Autumn Festival, organized by the Student Council of 
              the "Grigore Moisil" National College.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;The aim of the workshop was to introduce the children to the Fable 
                robots and to teach them how to program them. They were encouraged to work in teams, 
                collaborate and share their ideas to find the most efficient solutions to simulate a 
                soccer match between robots. The enthusiasm of the students and their desire to test 
                as many commands as possible for these robots showed us that the passion for the 
                field of technology is present from an early age, so that through our activities 
                we aim to encourage them to be curious and to discover this field, step by step.

              recycles common PET bottles and creates filament from them that
              can be used to print 3D objects.

                <br />&emsp;The main audience, the children, was captivated by

                what we exhibited at the stand, there were no other interactive activities. 
                Thus, we have proposed that in the future, where possible, we will

                <br />&emsp;The participating team consisted of nine members
                and a mentor. Ready for any challenge, we enthusiastically welcomed
                the camp's game theme. Motivated to offer
                their best versions, five days later, the representatives
                of the "Zenith" Robotics Club debuted with a robot that
                impressed with its innovation.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The matches took
                place at Iulius Mall Timișoara, in an atmosphere full of suspense.

              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;Like the 2023 bootcamp, this one aimed to recruit new 
                members passionate about robotics. Those who were admitted to the 
                bootcamp following the interviews in June, attended general presentations 
                of the 4 departments - mechanics, programming, graphics and PR - and 
                had the opportunity to put the acquired information into practice.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The preparation for the graphics department consisted 
                of creating various promotional materials with our team's design, 
                and for the PR department, sessions were held on managing social 
                networks and contacting sponsors. Last but not least, those who 
                wanted to be part of the mechanics department had the chance to 
                deepen their knowledge in 3D design, using the Autodesk Fusion program, 
                and, together with the programming group, they managed, by the end 
                of the 2-week bootcamp, to design, assemble and program a functional 
                robot.
                <br><br>&emsp;Finally, we simulated the atmosphere of a competition 
                through a mini-competition inspired by the theme of the game from 
                two years ago, PowerPlay.
                <br><br>&emsp;This year's Bootcamp represented a chance for each 
                participant to develop their practical robotics skills, 
                alongside people who share the same passion.

              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;The presented projects were structured around two
                main themes: "Smart City" and "Colonizing the Planet Mars". In
                this context, we transformed the SMART laboratory of the
                college into a representation of the planet Mars, while the
                physics laboratory was set up to represent planet Earth. On
                "planet Mars" we presented the FTC robot and Fable-type robots,
                which demonstrate our skills in robotics and advanced
                engineering. These projects highlighted the technological
                potential necessary for the exploration and colonization of
                other planets. On "planet Earth" we showcased a wide range of
                smart solutions for the urban environment. Among our projects
                were a smart house, a functional elevator with sensors, and
                mini Lego car-robots with automatic traffic lights.
                <br /><br />&emsp;In addition, we simulated advanced research
                centers in fields such as optics, nuclear energy, and medicine,
                using specific equipment and images. These centers were
                designed to illustrate the complexity and diversity of

              Winning Alliance - Open Robotics Intelligent Grid
            </h4>
            <p class="text">
              &emsp;Between September 6-10, 2023, we participated in the Open
              Robotics Intelligent Grid camp, organized by the West University
              of Timișoara in collaboration with the CSH robotics team of the
              National Pedagogical College "Carmen Sylva".
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;Six members, accompanied by a mentor, went to
                Timișoara to develop their skills and to learn how to build a
                robot in record time. The main challenge of the camp was to
                build a functional robot in 48 hours, using only the parts we
                brought with us from Bucharest. In addition to gaining
                knowledge about mechanics and programming, we met many robotics
                teams from all over the country, forming friendships with young
                people passionate about the same fields as us.
                <br /><br />&emsp;In the competition finals, we were chosen in
                an alliance by the Modus Vivendi team, alongside whom we won
                after a spectacular and emotional match. We returned home with
                the “Winning Alliance” trophy and with great hopes for the
                upcoming challenges and the new FTC season.

            <p class="text">
              &emsp;In the summer of 2023, the "Zenith" robotics club organized
              a bootcamp for new members. This training period consisted of two
              weeks during which students learned basic notions of robotics
              from mentors or senior members.
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;The first week of the bootcamp took place
                in-person, in the SmartLab of the "Grigore Moisil" National
                College. It started with an introduction to the FIRST Tech
                Challenge, and after a lot of theoretical information about
                robotics, the mechanics department had to build a robot
                inspired by the PowerPlay season. CAD courses were also held,
                where students learned to design various parts in Fusion 360,
                as well as to print them using 3D printers. In addition, the
                programming department presented several applications created
                with the help of Arduino boards, while the graphics and PR
                departments held workshops on social media posts, poster design
                and contacting sponsors.
                <br /><br />&emsp;The second week of the bootcamp was held
                online, and students enjoyed several programming, graphics, and
                PR sessions, accompanied by discussions based on the GM0
                robotics manual.
                <br /><br />&emsp;They were two wonderful weeks in which, in
                addition to the technical knowledge gained, the new members had
                the chance to meet other people who share the same passion as
                them—robotics.

              &emsp;The EggDrop Challenge is a competition organized by the
              Zenith Robotics Club at the "Grigore Moisil" National College. It
              involves creating a device designed to protect an egg, dropped
              freely from a certain height (the first or second floor).
              <span class="read-more-text">
                <br />&emsp;In 2023, the second edition of this competition
                took place, where the creativity and enthusiasm of our
                colleagues exceeded our expectations. During the event, each
                team had the opportunity to test their device up to two times,
                with the best result being taken into account. Thus, the prizes
                were awarded based on the performance of the devices, the
                technical notebook (which contained information about the
                project’s construction process), and the jury’s vote.
                <br /><br />&emsp;We are happy to promote the applicability of
                physics and to closely observe the talent and ingenuity of our
                school’s students.
